Notes: 
-  NOTE: when training, the moving_mean and moving_variance need to be updated. By default the update ops are placed in tf.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS, so they need to be added as a dependency to the train_op.(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/batch_normalization)

- may want to consider switching to softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2
